# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Links
- There are multiple types of links, such as: Links from one website to another, links from one webpage to another, links that open a new browser window, and links that start up your email program. 
- Links are created by using the `<a>` element, and users can click on anything between the opening and closing a tag. 
- Links are super important because they allow web surfers to travel from one webpage to another with just a click of a link! When you are linking to other pages on the same site, you can use a relative URL. But to link to other sites must specify the domain name like this:"https//www.example.com". 
- There are five relative link types and they are: Same Folder, Child Folder, Grandchild Folder, Parent Folder, and Grandparent Folder. To open a link in a new window just use a target attribute and set its value to "blank".

## Layouts
- For starters CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in it's own box. This box is either block-level or an inline-box. 
- Block level boxes act as the main building block of any layout.
- Inline boxes flow between surrounding text. 

## Float
- A lot of layouts place boxes next to each other. You can achieve this look, by using the float property. CSS Frameworks make the design process alot easier because they provide code for layout grids and styling forms. 

## JavaScript
- JavaScript functions allow you to define a block of code, you can nave it whatever you want and also run it as many times as you want!
- Fuctions are a series of statements that perform a specific task.
- Methods work the same way as functions do, but they are created inside of objects. 
- Objects are created by the individual. They contain and they contain properties and methods.
